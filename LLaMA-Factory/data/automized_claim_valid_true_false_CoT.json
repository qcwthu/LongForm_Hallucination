        "output": "True. According to multiple sources, Boeing did not provide adequate training to pilots on the MCAS system. In fact, Boeing's objective was to minimize training requirements for pilots already qualified on the 737NG. This lack of training was a major factor in the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed a total of 346 people. The FAA later required all MAX pilots to undergo MCAS-related training in flight simulators by 2021."

In the context of glucose uptake, allosteric inhibitors can bind to enzymes involved in glucose uptake, such as hexokinase, and regulate their activity. This can lead to changes in glucose uptake in cells. For example, a study published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry found that an allosteric inhibitor of hexokinase reduced glucose uptake in cancer cells (PMID: 28751464)."

Dedekind's work on Dedekind cuts, as outlined in his book 'Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen' (Continuity and Irrational Numbers), provided a rigorous and systematic way of defining the real numbers, and it has had a profound impact on the development of mathematics, particularly in the areas of real analysis, functional analysis, and topology."

It is commonly used to analyze the frequency response of digital systems, which is closely related to the impulse response. The impulse response of a digital system can be obtained by taking the inverse Fourier Transform of the frequency response. Therefore, the Fourier Transform is used to analyze the impulse response of digital systems, but not directly."

The CMBR is found to be extremely uniform throughout the universe, with only tiny fluctuations in temperature. These fluctuations are thought to have seeded the formation of galaxies. The uniformity of the CMBR is a direct prediction of the Big Bang theory and is a strong evidence for it."

The event triggered a chain reaction of political alliances and military mobilizations that eventually led to the war. The war lasted from 1914 to 1918, with the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne being signed on November 11, 1918, and the Treaty of Versailles being signed on June 28, 1919."

This is evident from the fact that the US refused to join the League of Nations after World War I, and also passed the Neutrality Acts in the 1930s, which were designed to prevent the US from becoming involved in another European war. Additionally, the America First Committee, which was formed in 1940, was a prominent isolationist group that advocated for the US to stay out of World War II."

This theory was able to explain the motion of planets, moons, and comets, as well as the tides and the precession of the equinoxes. Newton's theory was a major breakthrough in understanding the natural world and remained the dominant explanation of the motion of celestial bodies for over two centuries until it was superseded by Einstein's theory of general relativity."

The crisis ended in November 1923, when the German government introduced a new currency, the Rentenmark, which was backed by gold and stopped the inflation. The Dawes Plan, which was implemented in 1924, helped to stabilize the German economy and restructure the reparations payments."
